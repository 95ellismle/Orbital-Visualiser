** If plotting real phase (no imag but still phase) then don't create the imag cube file!





Call phaseMasks -> phaseBoundaries

#testing.py
Need to impose a limit on the number of phase sectors. I think 12 should be max. This is because the
   number of VMD colors is very limited.

Need to create a dict that maps the sectors that are opposites to pos and neg
   (keys must correspond to the keys in the phaseBoundaries)


#main.py
Change the way the colors are entered -> to a dictionary (keys must match up with the phaseBoundaries keys)

loop over phaseBoundaries and create a dict of masks (with keys from phaseBoundaries)

apply these masks and create a dictionary with lots of data arrays containing the data from each mask

update the findCubesToWrite function to loop over all phaseBoundaries

update the set_wf_colors function to loop over all phaseBoundaries
