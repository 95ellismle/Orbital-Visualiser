        <p>
            The code works by plotting the magnitude of the electronic
            wavefunction. This is expressed below as a chain of basis function
            expansions.

      <h5>Spherical Harmonics</h5>
      <p>
        The first expansion has the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_spherical_harmonics#Real_spherical_harmonics' target="_blank">real spherical harmonics</a>
        as its basis function. Each p-orbital is centered on an atom and its
        orientation is determined by the expansion coefficient (in this case
        the pvecs) as shown below:
        <img src="*doc_img_folder*/POrb.png" width=100%/>
        The code currently only works with p-orbitals. However, other orbitals
        should be simple to add later.

      <h5>AOM Coefficient</h5>
      <p>
          The next basis expansion is the AOM one. The expansion coefficient
          here determines how big the p orbital is on each atom. E.g. a larger
