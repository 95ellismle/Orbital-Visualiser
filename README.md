# Orbital Visualiser

This project has been created to visualise the output of the Surface Hopping, Ehrenfest and CTMQC modules of CP2K. Full instructions can be found by initialising the HTML documentation.

To do this run the Create_docs.py file with python3 i.e:

` python3 Create_docs.py`

you can then open the newly created **Documentation.html** with your favourite browser. For example you could run the command:

`firefox Documentation.html`

This file should lead you through your first steps in visualising the output of your simulations.

Some examples of the output of this code to give you an idea of what it does are below!
