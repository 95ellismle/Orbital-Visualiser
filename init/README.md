<p>
   The files in this folder are concerned with the initialisation of the code. This involves reading all the data input files, parsing the settings.inp file and defaults file and choosing which ones to use, and other functions related to setting things up. The main file in this folder is the INIT.py file which calls all the relevant functions to initialise the code.
